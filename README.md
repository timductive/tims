## Local Setup
If you are setting up from a brand new Ubuntu install, first [install ruby](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37720892/you-dont-have-write-permissions-for-the-var-lib-gems-2-3-0-directory).

After you have Ruby installed, install bundler and jekyll.
```
gem install bundler
gem install jekyll
```

Then install things local to this repo
```
cd ./tims
bundle install
```

Now you can run the server locally
```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
